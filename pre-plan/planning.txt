Keywords: Threading process, create threads, discover mutexes, Data race, scramble, mutex for printing, deadlock
MUTEXES:
1 for each fork
1 for DIE
1 for PRINT
Overview: 
--1 or more philo at round table
--spaghetti in middle.
Things they can do- ONLY ONE AT A TIME:
EAT
THINK
SLEEP
forks: As many as philos
philo need 2 forks to EAT Left and right-> 2 wont be able to eat, if they smart and dont take 1 fork without being able to take the other
CYCLE: EAT->SLEEP->THINKING
ALL NEED TO EAT
NO SPEAK
DONT KNOW WHEN OTHER DIE

rules:
- no global variables
- args: 
number_of_philosophers
time to DIE in milliseconds
time to eat in milliseconds
time to sleep in milliseconds
number of times each philo eat(optional)

LOGS: (no lag more than 10ms)

◦ timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is eating
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is thinking
◦ timestamp_in_ms X died

New Things: fflush(stdout);

FKTIONS: 
memset, printf, malloc, free, write,
usleep, gettimeofday, pthread_create,
pthread_detach, pthread_join, pthread_mutex_init,
pthread_mutex_destroy, pthread_mutex_lock,
pthread_mutex_unlock

Flow: 
argv check for right number of args
init philo -> create thread for each philo
create mutexes->
ALWAYS CHECK FOR FAILS (for creating thread and for create mutexes, delete/free up to then)
